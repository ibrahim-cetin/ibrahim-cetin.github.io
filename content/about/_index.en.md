# About Me

Hello, I'm **İbrahim Çetin**

For me, game development is not just about writing code; it's about building worlds that offer players unforgettable experiences.

I focus on **VR (Oculus Meta Quest 2)**, **XR technologies**, and high-performance system design within the **Unity and C#** ecosystem. From my Steam-published project **Veilborn** to my award-winning Game Jam games like **Monochrom**, I prioritize establishing scalable and clean software architecture in all my work.

I love not only creating but also sharing. I continue to pass on my passion for technology to new generations by teaching Unity and Python at **Algorithmics**. I always strive to stay on top of new technologies by exploring what lies beyond.

## My Technical Approach and Expertise

I value being a developer who **"designs systems"** rather than just "writes code." I base my projects on these principles:

**System Design**  
Architecting modular, sustainable, and performance-focused C# structures.

**Modern Technologies**  
Developing flexible game mechanics using approaches like Scriptable Objects, Design Patterns, and Event Bus.

**XR Experience**  
Providing natural interaction systems and user experience (UX) optimization in VR and AR environments.

**Data and Performance**  
Optimally connecting data management to game mechanics through DTO and API integrations.
