**ALEM** is an interactive **mobile AR demo project** that brings historical and cultural values together with modern technology. This project was developed as a **Proof of Concept** aimed at transforming a museum visit or historical research from a static experience into a living digital adventure.

## Project Vision

Going beyond traditional exhibition methods; the goal was to enrich artifacts and structures that are on the verge of being forgotten with a digital layer. Within the scope of the demo, fundamental mechanics and user flows that increase cultural awareness by combining the physical world with technology were successfully simulated.

## Software Infrastructure and Built Systems

Although the project is in demo phase, the core software architecture and AR system infrastructure of the application were completely designed by me and brought to life in a functional structure in Unity:

### Completed AR Tracking System (Image Tracking)

Using Unity's **AR Foundation** library, I built a high-precision image tracking system that works through physical objects or markers. This system ensures all artifacts used in the demo are recognized correctly and digital content is placed with millimeter accuracy.

### Modular Data Management (Scriptable Objects)

I developed a modular architecture based on **Scriptable Objects** to manage artifact data within the application. This system is completely operational and allows new artifacts to be integrated into the system in seconds without creating any complexity on the code side.

### Functional Save and Achievement System

The basic save system that tracks users' exploration processes and progress within the application is fully established. This infrastructure, which also includes user login logic, ensures data is consistently stored throughout the demo.

### Application Logic and Flow Management

All interaction scenarios and the application's core loop were coded by me. All user interactions in the demo are optimized to provide stable performance and a steady application flow.

## Features Within Demo Scope

**Built AR Interaction Infrastructure**  
AR system ready for interaction with all connections made on the software side.

**Sustainable Code Structure**  
Expandable and clean software architecture suitable for converting the project to a full version.
